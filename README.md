Using the (PhyPhox app)[https://phyphox.org/], the following data sets were recorded and then graphed.

The cart was built from a rectangular piece of carton, a skewer, a drinking straw, tape and bottle caps. 


## Cart Down Hill

The cart is rolling down a slightly inclined plane before hitting the floor.

## Cart has Collision

Cart is pushed, then let slow down for a short while, before it collides with object
